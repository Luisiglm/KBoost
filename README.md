KBoost: A package to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data

KBoost is a gene regulatory network inference algorithm using gene expression data. It has been benchmarked using three datasets. It builds several models unsing kernel principal components regression and boosting and from them estimates the probability that each transcription factor regulates a gene.
