# KBoost
KBoost: A package to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data

KBoostv: The new testing version of the KBoost package.

KBoost is a gene regulatory network inference algorithm. It builds several models unsing kernel principal components regression and boosting and from them estimates the probability that each transcription factor regulates a gene.
KBoost has one main function: K_Boost_Basic and two more case specific functions, K_Boost_Basic_No_Prior and K_Boost_H. We have also included a few simulated and experimental datasets from publicly available sources.
 
The folder FFNN contains feed forward neural network to predict the TP53 mutation status.

The folder KBoost_0.0.0.9000 contains the R KBoost package.

The folder KBoost Matlab contains a Matlab implementation of KBoost.
