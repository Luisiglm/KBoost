KBoost: A package to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data

KBoost is a gene regulatory network inference algorithm. It builds several models unsing kernel principal components regression and boosting and from them estimates the probability that each transcription factor regulates a gene.
KBoost has one main function: K_Boost_Basic and two more case specific functions, K_Boost_Basic_No_Prior and K_Boost_H. We have also included a few simulated and experimental datasets from publicly available sources.
